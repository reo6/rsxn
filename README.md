  <h1>rsxn</h1>

  Pretty basic Minecraft server launcher, written in Rust.
</div>

## Why?

I needed a simple program (instead of a bat/sh file) to launch my Minecraft servers (to play with friends).

Also I needed a side-hustle alongside work to... well, stay alive.

## How do I install?

Go to the [releases](https://github.com/reo6/rsxn/releases) and grab a file or clone the project and run ``cargo build --publish``.
